# Open Source AI For Robotics Career and Degree

The purpose of this is provide myself and others an educational guide towards AI for Robotics using openly available materials.  To avoid the paradox of choice, I'm going to have the "best" course (highly subjective and will vary based on how you learn) first, and a few supplemental courses below it if I feel like it.  This will evolve over time.  Putting in random courses I think are fun.  Enjoy hopefully!

## Minimal Viable Product Career Path:

1. Complete a simple robotics project and make sure the code is in your Github
2. Call yourself a Robotics Engineer or Perception Engineer or whatever on LinkedIn and add a bunch of recruiters
3. Study for interviews, and inform your studying by what you miss in interviews
4. Work on fun passion projects to keep your motivation up and brag excitedly about to interviewers
5. Study CS and Math to fill in your gaps

Often the easiest first job to get is in consulting if you don't have a strong CS background when you start your career.

## Core CS - Most interviews are very very data structures and algorithms structured
